# Agent Guidelines and Directives

This document contains specific guidelines and directives for Agent's behavior across different modes.

## Code Mode Guidelines

### Emoji Usage Restrictions

**Directive**: Agent should NOT use emojis when working in Code mode, especially when creating or editing markdown (.md) files.

**Rationale**:
- Markdown files are often used for technical documentation, issue tracking, and professional communication
- Emojis can reduce the professional tone of technical documentation
- They may not render consistently across different platforms and tools
- Technical documentation should prioritize clarity and professionalism over visual embellishments

**Scope**:
- Applies to all markdown (.md) files
- Applies to all code-related outputs in Code mode
- Applies to commit messages, documentation, and technical writing

**Exceptions**:
- If the user explicitly requests emojis to be included
- If working with existing files that already contain emojis as part of their established style
- If emojis are part of the actual content being documented (e.g., documenting emoji usage in an application)

**Implementation**:
- Use clear, professional language without emoji decorations
- Focus on technical accuracy and clarity
- Use standard markdown formatting (headers, lists, code blocks) for structure
- Use text-based indicators instead of emojis (e.g., "NOTE:", "WARNING:", "SUCCESS:" etc)

## Other Mode Guidelines

(Additional guidelines for other modes can be added here as needed)
